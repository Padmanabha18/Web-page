    Home roasting is the process of roasting coffee from green coffee beans on a small scale for personal consumption. Home
    roasting of coffee has been practiced for centuries, using simple methods such as roasting in cast iron skillets over a
    wood fire and hand-turning small steel drums on a kitchen stovetop.

<p style="width:50%">
    Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The
    roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in
    taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have
    been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur
    during roasting.

<p style="width:50%">
    Coffee production in Colombia has a reputation for producing mild, well-balanced coffee beans.
    Colombia's
    average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and Vietnam,
    though highest in terms of the arabica bean.
    The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France,
    Japan, and Italy.Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region, while other regions focus on
    quality instead of volumes, such as Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. In 2007, the European Union granted Colombian coffee a
    protected designation of origin status.In 2011, UNESCO declared the "Coffee Cultural Landscape" of Colombia,a
    World Heritage site.
