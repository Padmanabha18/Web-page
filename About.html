        <p style="width: 100%;">
        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. All fruit
        must be further processed from a raw material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, raw product; un-roasted, green coffee.
        To process the berries, the seed is separated from the fruit to produce green coffee. Green coffee is then roasted, a
        process which transforms the raw product (green coffee) into a consumable product (roasted coffee). Roasted coffee is
        ground into a powder and mixed with water to produce a cup of coffee.
        
        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine
        content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways
        (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled
        or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be
        served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee
        beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).
        
        Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy
        adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of
        the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.
        
        The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia
        in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar
        to how it is now prepared for drinking.
        The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via
        coastal Somali intermediaries, and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle
        East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.
